# Explanation

### Line of Credit
A line of credit, abbreviated as LOC, is an arrangement between a financial institution, usually a bank, and a customer that establishes a maximum loan balance that the lender permits the borrower to access or maintain. The borrower can access funds from the line of credit at any time, as long as he does not exceed the maximum amount set in the agreement and as long as he meets any other requirements set by the financial institution, such as making timely minimum payment

### Revolving Accounts
A line of credit is a type of revolving account. This means that the borrower can spend the money, repay it and spend it again, in a virtually never-ending, revolving cycle. Revolving accounts such as lines of credit and credit cards exist in contrast to installment loans such as mortgages, car loans and signature loans.

### Derogatory Public Records
Public records and collections are derogatory items because they all reflect financial obligations that were not paid as agreed.

There are three kinds of public records that appear on a credit report: bankruptcy filings, tax liens, and judgments. Public record information is collected and updated regularly from the courts.
